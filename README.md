# BananaJoPy

BananaJoPy is a fun and engaging 2D game built with Pygame. The game involves a banana, obstacles, and a box, I hope you like the box. The banana is shot and bounces around the screen, and the game checks for collisions with obstacles and the box. The game also includes features like a menu, score tracking, and different levels.
The game is completely mouse controlled, you hold the mouse button down and drag to the opposit direction as you want to shoot. Like with a sling-shot.
